# Todo CLI

This is a basic command-line app I made using Rust. I made it while learning Rust, using it as a hands-on exercise to get better at what I've picked up so far. Right now, I'm still diving into Rust and getting better at it, and this project shows how far I've come in understanding the ins and outs of Rust's syntax and features.

## Features

- Add a new task
- Mark a task as done or undone
- View all tasks
- Delete a task
- Quit the application

## How to Use

You can interact with the application using the following commands:

- To add a new task, type `Add "your task here"`. For example, `Add "Learn Rust"`.
- To mark a task as done or undone, type `Done [index]`. The index is the position of the task in the list, starting from 0. For example, `Done 1`.
- To view all tasks, simply type `View`.
- To delete a task, type `Delete [index]`. For example, `Delete 1`.
- To quit the application, simply type `Quit`.

## Building the Application

To build this application, ensure you have Rust installed on your system. Navigate to the project directory and use the following command:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

This will create a binary in ./target/release/.

To make the binary executable from any location on your system, move it to a location in your system's PATH. For example, on a Unix-like system like MacOS or Linux, you might move it to /usr/local/bin:

```bash
mv ./target/release/todo-list /usr/local/bin/
```

Now you can run the todo command from any location in your terminal.

## Error Handling
The application handles errors such as loading and saving todos. If an error occurs, it will print a warning message but will not crash the application.

## Persistence
The application stores the todos in a file named "todos.txt", allowing the data to persist between sessions.
